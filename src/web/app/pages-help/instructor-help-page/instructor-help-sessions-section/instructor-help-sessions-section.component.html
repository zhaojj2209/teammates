    <p>
      Any evaluation system has both positive and negative effects on those being evaluated.
      As teachers, you are probably keen to maximize the positive effect of this system on your course while minimizing any negative effects.
      Here are some of the things you could do:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Have frequent peer evaluations.</b><br>
        Rather than have only one peer evaluation at the end of the course, have several peer evaluations at different points of the course. This way, students get frequent peer-feedback about their contribution, giving them plenty of chances to correct their conduct as necessary.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ignore early peer evaluations.</b><br>
        Consider not using initial peer evaluations for grading. Let students know that in advance. This gives students time to get used to the system and be more relaxed in giving early feedback to peers.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Interpret contribution numbers with care.</b><br>
        If you use 'Team contribution' type questions in your peer evaluations, keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based on student perceptions and may not reflect the real contribution of a student. Therefore, use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.
        <br> You may ignore minor variations in the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES. The difference between [Equal share] and [Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to rounding off within the system.
        <br> <br>Keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from others when one's own contribution is being compared to that of others. As a result, it is common for the 'perceived contribution' to be somewhat lower than what the student actually did.
        <br> When taking further actions based on evaluation reports, also pay attention to the team's consensus level about the contribution of a student. For example, you can take further actions with more confidence if all team members rated a certain student's contribution low.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tolerate unequal contributions.</b><br>
        This may be a good policy to adopt (If students know this policy, they will be more honest in reporting contribution values):
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>It is OK to do less than an equal share of the work, as long as you are willing to accept a lower grade than your team members. It is your right to decide how much time you allocate to this course. How you prioritize your work is your own business.</i>
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Announce a 'cooling off' period.</b><br>
        This may be a good guidelines to give to students:
        <br><br>
        <i>If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received, please allow at least one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle such a situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.</i>

        <b>Feedback Path</b>: define who is giving feedback, and who the feedback is about.
        Select a common feedback path from the drop-down menu, or choose "Other predefined combinations..."
        to define the Feedback Giver and Recipient separately.
        If you choose a 'team' as the giver, any member can submit the response on behalf of the team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Visibility options</b>: let students know who will be able to see their answers.
        Select a common visibility option from the drop-down menu, or choose "Custom visibility options..."

    </ul>
    <p>
      In the example question below, students will give feedback on their own team members.
      The team member receiving feedback can see the feedback, but not who gave the feedback.
      Instructors can see who received what feedback, and who gave the feedback.

      No action is required from you for this. TEAMMATES will send an email (containing submission instructions) to each respondent when the session opens for submissions.
      After that email has been sent out (you will receive a copy of it, for your reference), you are welcome to inform respondents using another means (outside of TEAMMATES) to look out for the TEAMMATES email.

      Reason: The current visibility setting of each question is shown to the respondent at the point of response submission i.e., responses are submitted based on the promise of a certain visibility.

      Currently it is not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you change the team structure midway, the new team structure will apply to all current/past sessions as well, and will cause any 'incompatible' responses (e.g., responses submitted in relation to a team that no longer exists) to be deleted automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workarounds (neither is optimal, unfortunately):
    </p>
    <ol class="different-team-ol">
      <li>
        Create a different course for each team structure you want to support.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep changing the team structure as necessary but download the existing responses before changing it -- this works only if it is not important for students to be able to view responses to past sessions.
